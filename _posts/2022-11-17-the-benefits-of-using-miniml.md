I've been doing CMS for over 20 years and I know a thing or two. But what really gets me these days is how bloated the software for the standard platforms are. And now with how popular Wordpress is, it's really sad to see how much effort it takes to run a WP site nowadays. I have to say, 

> The real value of using Miniml is the fact that it is much less likely to get hacked than any other CMS you could find.

Since I manage sites from many different platforms, I get to see the inside out of how system's work and that's why I developed Miniml. It's just the bare minimum system that I use on every site I develop. I'm mainly interested in picking a framework and then getting to know it well. For Miniml, I chose to use the UiKit framework by YooTheme which is IMHO the best for getting interactive experiences with javascript and css and less bloated and more feature rich than bootstrap. UIKit has everything I need. I'm barely scratching the surface of what can be done.
