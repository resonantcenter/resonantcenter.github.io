Since 2017, there has been an explosion of focus on UX. What I want to know is. "How can we make it better". That's all I care about with UX. The dream is to have a perfect running system but the truth is that there is always bugs and just like in agile development or other software development systems, bugs are methods of bettering the software. 

It is our process of looking at what is wrong and what we focus on that brings our ideas into concrete function. All I want to do is make it better. All the time. Let's do it together!
