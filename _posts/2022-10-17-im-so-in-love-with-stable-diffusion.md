It's only been a small time since the first release of Stable Diffusion and I am totally in love with it. This is truly a game changer. Looking forward to producing some awesome music videos and psychedelic graphics with this. There's something awesome about letting the computer do the work for you. I dig how there is still real skill involved in setting up and building the animations. There's really just so much you can do with this. 

My goal is to master these early releases and produce some mega wow animations that get me into the market in a big way. It took me a long time to get to the know the software, but now I'm ready. I feel like I can do anything with it!
