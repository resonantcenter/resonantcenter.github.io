As of March 1st, 2022, I have migrated all content under my personal github brand from the very long name isaacjosephhorton to kre8t. The reason for this change is the time it takes to type my previous username which comes up enough for it to be annoying.

The new namespace change is a consolidation of all my old work into a single structured site and portfolio which should be released some time this summer.
